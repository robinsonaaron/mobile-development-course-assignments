# Ionic Assignment 2 - Iongithub Update

Update the [Iongithub app](https://github.com/robinsonaaron/iongithub) to include the following functionality:
1. When a user clicks on the "followers" link it should populate a list of followers below the followers link, similar to how the list of repositories is listed when a user clicks on the repositories link. The list should be an ion-list with ion-items within the list. Each ion-item will contain an avatar image and a name for the follower, the list item should look similar to how the picture and name are displayed when searching for a github profile within the app.
2. When a user clicks one of the followers, then a modal popup displays a card with the avatar of the user along with details of your choosing about the follower below.
3. Include a close button in the header, so that a user can close the modal popup.
